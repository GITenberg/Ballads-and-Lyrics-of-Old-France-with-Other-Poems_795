<h3><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>LIST OF
POETS TRANSLATED.</h3>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Charles D&rsquo;Orleans</span>,
who has sometimes, for no very obvious reason, been styled the
father of French lyric poetry, was born in May, 1391.&nbsp; He
was the son of Louis D&rsquo;Orleans, the grandson of Charles V.,
and the father of Louis XII.&nbsp; Captured at Agincourt, he was
kept in England as a prisoner from 1415 to 1440, when he returned
to France, where he died in 1465.&nbsp; His verses, for the most
part roundels on two rhymes, are songs of love and spring, and
retain the allegorical forms of the Roman de la Rose.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;ois Villon</span>,
1431&ndash;14-?&nbsp; Nothing is known of Villon&rsquo;s birth or
death, and only too much of his life.&nbsp; In his poems the
ancient forms of French verse are animated with the keenest sense
of personal emotion, of love, of melancholy, of mocking despair,
and of repentance for a life passed in taverns and prisons.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Joachim Du Bellay</span>,
1525&ndash;1560.&nbsp; The exact date of Du Bellay&rsquo;s birth
is unknown.&nbsp; He was certainly a little younger than Ronsard,
who was born in September, 1524, although an attempt has been
made to prove that his birth took place in 1525, as a
compensation from Nature to France for the battle of Pavia.&nbsp;
As a poet Du Bellay had the start, by a few mouths, of Ronsard;
his <i>Recueil</i> was published in 1549.&nbsp; The question of
priority in the new style of poetry caused a quarrel, which did
not long separate the two singers.&nbsp; Du Bellay is perhaps the
most interesting of the Pleiad, that company of Seven, who
attempted to reform French verse, by inspiring it with the
enthusiasm of the Renaissance.&nbsp; His book <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span><i>L&rsquo;Illustration de la langue Fran&ccedil;aise</i>
is a plea for the study of ancient models and for the improvement
of the vernacular.&nbsp; In this effort Du Bellay and Ronsard are
the predecessors of Malherbe, and of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier,
more successful through their frank eagerness than the former,
less fortunate in the possession of critical learning and
appreciative taste than the latter.&nbsp; There is something in
Du Bellay&rsquo;s life, in the artistic nature checked by
occupation in affairs&mdash;he was the secretary of Cardinal Du
Bellay&mdash;in the regret and affection with which Rome
depressed and allured him, which reminds the English reader of
the thwarted career of Clough.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Remy Belleau</span>,
1528&ndash;1577.&nbsp; Du Belleau&rsquo;s life was spent in the
household of Charles de Lorraine, Marquis d&rsquo;Elboeuf, and
was marked by nothing more eventful than the usual pilgrimage to
Italy, the sacred land and sepulchre of art.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pierre Ronsard</span>,
1524&ndash;1585.&nbsp; Ronsard&rsquo;s early years gave little
sign of his vocation.&nbsp; He was for some time a page of the
court, was in the service of James V. of Scotland, and had his
share of shipwrecks, battles, and amorous adventures.&nbsp; An
illness which produced total deafness made him a scholar and
poet, as in another age and country it might have made him a
saint and an ascetic.&nbsp; With all his industry, and almost
religious zeal for art, he is one of the poets who make
themselves, rather than are born singers.&nbsp; His epic, the
Franciade, is as tedious as other artificial epics, and his odes
are almost unreadable.&nbsp; We are never allowed to forget that
he is the poet who read the Iliad through in three days.&nbsp; He
is, as has been said of Le Brun, more mythological than
Pindar.&nbsp; His constant allusion to his grey hair, an
affectation which may be noticed in Shelley, is borrowed from
Anacreon.&nbsp; Many of the sonnets in which he
&lsquo;petrarquizes,&rsquo; retain the faded odour of the roses
he loved; and his songs have fire and melancholy and a sense as
of perfume from &lsquo;a closet long to quiet vowed, with mothed
and dropping arras hung.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ronsard&rsquo;s great fame
declined when is <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Malherbe came to &lsquo;bind the sweet influences of the
Pleiad,&rsquo; but he has been duly honoured by the newest school
of French poetry.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jacques Tahureau</span>,
1527&ndash;1555.&nbsp; The amorous poetry of Jacques Tahureau has
the merit, rare in his, or in any age, of being the real
expression of passion.&nbsp; His brief life burned itself away
before he had exhausted the lyric effusion of his youth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Le plus beau gentilhomme de son si&egrave;cle, et le plus
dextre &agrave; toutes sortes de gentillesses,&rsquo; died at the
age of twenty-eight, fulfilling the presentiment which tinges,
but scarcely saddens his poetry.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jean Passerat</span>,
1534&ndash;1602.&nbsp; Better known as a political satirist than
as a poet.</p>
<h3>POETS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Francois
Villon</span>, 1460</p>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">have</span> a tree, a
graft of Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in my heart has taken root;<br />
Sad are the buds and blooms thereof,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bitter sorrow is its fruit;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, since it was a tender shoot,<br />
So greatly hath its shadow spread,<br />
That underneath all joy is dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my pleasant days are flown,<br />
Nor can I slay it, nor instead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant any tree, save this alone.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; My tears were rain about its root,<br />
And though the fruit be harsh thereof,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I scarcely looked for better fruit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than this, that carefully I put<br />
In garner, for the bitter bread<br />
Whereon my weary life is fed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, better were the soil unsown<br />
That bears such growths; but Love instead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will plant no tree, but this alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, would that this new spring, whereof<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaves and flowers flush into shoot,<br />
I might have succour and aid of Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prune these branches at the root,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That long have borne such bitter fruit,<br />
And graft a new bough, comforted<br />
With happy blossoms white and red;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So pleasure should for pain atone,<br />
Nor Love slay this tree, nor instead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant any tree, but this alone.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Look on us six that are hanging thus,<br />
And for the flesh that so much we cherished<br />
How it is eaten of birds and perished,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ashes and dust fill our bones&rsquo; place,<br

Ye wot no man so wise is born<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Be ye then merciful, and cry<br />
To Mary&rsquo;s Son that is piteous,<br />
That His mercy take no stain from us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saving us out of the fiery place.<br />
We are but dead, let no soul deny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pray God succour us of His grace.</p>

hair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round are we tossed, and here and there,<br />
This way and that, at the wild wind&rsquo;s will,<br />
Never a moment my body is still;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Birds they are busy about my face.<br />
Live not as we, nor fare as we fare;<br />

New born we walked among the new world&rsquo;s ways.</p>

Followed, and found her not, and seeking you<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
